# Logistics-Optimization-for-Delivery-Routes-SQL
# Objectives: 
Build a SQL-driven logistics analytics system to analyze shipment performance, optimize routes, 
and enhance delivery efficiency across DHL’s global network. 
The project aims to: 
--> Identify delay patterns and operational inefficiencies. 

--> Optimize hub and route combinations for improved transit times. 

--> Analyze agent- and warehouse-level performance. 
# Tools used :
MySQL, MS Powerpoint, MS Excel, Power BI

# Dataset
 Orders Table,Routes Table, Warehouse Table, Delivery Agents Table, Shipment Tracking Table
# Tasks Performed 
Data Cleaning & Preparation, Delivery Delay Analysis, Route Optimization Insights creations, warehouse performance analysis, Delivery Agent performancea analysis, Shipment Tracking Analytics, Advanced KPI Reporting, creating a Powerpoint presentation

# Key Insights 
-->All routes exceed the 20% delay threshold, indicating a systemic delay issue across the network. This suggests either operational inefficiencies, strict delay definitions, or data representing a high-risk logistics period.

--> Routes with 100% or near 100% delay percentage should be optimized, and balanced shipment loads on hubs can reduce delays and improve efficiency, ultimately improving DHL’s logistics network.

--> Bottom-performing agents require training to develop skills 

--> They should be taught time management by familiarising them with routes and not rotating routes for agents.

--> Increase knowledge transfer programs by pairing top performers with bottom performers.
